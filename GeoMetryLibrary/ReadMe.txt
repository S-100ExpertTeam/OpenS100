    MFC Library: GeoMetryLibrary Project Overview
========================================================================

The Application Wizard has created this GeoMetry Library DLL. 
This DLL not only demonstrates the basic usage of MFC, 
but also provides the basic structure for writing a DLL.

This file contains a summary description of each file 
that makes up the GeoMetryLibrary DLL.

GeoMetryLibrary.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects created using the AppWizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, 
    as well as information about the platform, configuration, 
    and project capabilities selected using the AppWizard.

GeoMetryLibrary.vcxproj.filters
    A filter file for a VC++ project created using the AppWizard.
    This file contains connection information between the files 
    in the project and the filter.
    These associations are used by the IDE to display files grouped by 
    similar extensions on a particular node. For example, 
    a ".cpp" file is associated with a "source file" filter.

GeoMetryLibrary.h
    This is the main header file of the DLL, 
    and the CGeoMetryLibraryApp class is declared here.

GeoMetryLibrary.cpp
    This is the main DLL source file. Contains the CGeoMetryLibraryApp class.

GeoMetryLibrary.rc
    A list of all Microsoft Windows resources used by the program.
    This includes icons, bitmaps, and cursors stored in the RES subdirectory.
    This file can be edited directly in Microsoft Visual C++.

res\GeoMetryLibrary.rc2
    This file contains resources edited by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++.
    Any resources that cannot be edited with the resource editor 
    should be put in this file.

GeoMetryLibrary.def
    This file contains information about the DLL that must be provided 
    in order to run on Microsoft Windows, and it defines parameters 
    such as the DLL's name and description. 
    It also exports functions from the DLL.

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    This file is used to build the precompiled header (PCH) file GeoMetryLibrary.pch 
    and the precompiled format (PCT) file StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    A standard header file that defines a new resource ID.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

The "TODO:" comments used by AppWizard indicate portions of source code 
that you must add or customize.
